Pull requests are encouraged.

Please follow the following guidelines:

- Add at least a test to `examples/passing/` and possibly to `examples/failing`
- Run `cabal test`
- Consider adding a full test with Javascript to `examples/shelltest`
- Please run `hlint`.

If you would like to contribute, please consider the issues in the current milestone first.

Send me (`paf31`) a message if you have any implementation questions, I'm more than happy to talk about the design, and I'm more than willing to redesign parts if necessary.
